Automatically accept Portal dialogs for input capture and remote control

## Desktops

## About

This project is a peaceful protest against the new Portal permission dialogs for input capture and remote desktop, which can be found on Wayland desktops.

Users of applications like Deskflow, Synergy, and LAN Mouse find these dialogs frustrating.

The long-term goal for this project is for it to become obsolete once KDE and GNOME implement persistent permissions for the Portal dialogs.
